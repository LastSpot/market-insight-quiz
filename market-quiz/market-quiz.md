# Overview

This is a full stack project created with Next.js 15 app routers. The project is about testing users knowledge of market insight with a quiz like format. There will be a prompt generated by Google Gemini about the market and the user is to type in a short answer detailing what would happen to the market. Gemini will then take that answer and judge it and explain why the user is right or wrong or if there are any flaw.

# Logic 

The logic of the application will be as followed:

1. User click button to begin
2. Gemini generate a prompt about current market simulations
3. User types in their response
4. Gemini take the prompt as context then rate and give feedback on the response
5. User can click a button to start a new prompt
